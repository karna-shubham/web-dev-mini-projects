# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution

This is my take on the [QR Code Component Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) from Frontend Mentor. I'm doing these kinds of challenges to improve my frontend skills, get better at HTML & CSS, and most importantly — learn in public.

## 🚀 My Process

### 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox)
- Mobile-first workflow

### 💡 What I Learned

This was a super simple challenge, but it taught me a lot about the basics like:

- Structuring an HTML document properly
- Centering elements using Flexbox (which was tricky at first)
- Handling local images and organizing assets

Also learned how to set up a clean folder structure, use `.gitignore`, and prep a project for GitHub.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### 🔁 Continued Development

Going forward, I want to work on:

- Responsiveness for different screen sizes
- Building components with reusability in mind
- Exploring CSS Grid
